# Description

On the landing page, users can familiarize themselves with the site by reading a brief overview. As they scroll down, they will see a snapshot of the other pages of the site and read a brief description of each pages’ functionality. &nbsp;


The nav bar at the top of each page allows users to navigate from one page to another throughout the site.
The footer at the bottom allows users to sign up to receive newsletters as well as follow suggestions so they can receive updates about new features. &nbsp;


On the habits page, users can click to get a recommendation of a habit to track. They can add a new habit they’d like to track which dynamically creates a new habit with a calendar to track daily completion below. Once a habit is added, users can click to highlight the days of the month the user has successfully completed for each habit and click the done button to remove that habit when they are no longer interested in tracking that habit. &nbsp;


Over on the goals page, a user can add a new goal they’d like to track which dynamically creates a new goal below, and then continually add notes to track their progress. Once they’ve achieved their goal, they can then click the achieved button to remove that goal.
